### A Choice Experiment on the Elicitation of Preferences over Income Distributions 

with Max Lobeck, Claudia Senik and Thierry Verdier, <i>Draft available upon request</i>

We conduct a simple lab experiment where subjects make a series of choices on how to allocate a
bonus within a small firm that affect themselves and four other group members. By varying the characteristics of the distributions, we can infer subject's attitudes toward various types of inequalities and whether inequalities become acceptable when they meet Rawlsian justice principles. Using a within-subject design, individuals make the same binary choices both behind the veil of ignorance and when their relative position is revealed. Choosing behind the veil of ignorance relates to a situation where individuals are perfectly mobile between ranks, while within-firm mobility is restricted as soon as they redo the choices with their position being revealed. Moreover, rank is determined randomly for one half of the subjects (Control group) and through an effort-task for the other half (Treatment group). We find that when future rank is based on effort, subjects are more willing to accept inequalities that hurt the poorest group member behind the veil of ignorance. However, when the unequal distribution meets justice principles, virtually all subjects display Rawlsian preferences behind the veil of ignorance. Once rank is revealed, Rawlsian preferences still predominate but 25% of the subjects care more about disadvantageous inequalities than effciency. The within-subject analysis reveals the co-existence of two extreme behaviors: (1) Altruistic individuals that are sticking to their equality ideal even if it necessitates to lower their own payoff; (2) Money burners that reduce the income of top players without any redistributive effects. This anti-social behavior was non-existent behind the veil of ignorance and becomes visible as soon as upwards mobility is restricted.
