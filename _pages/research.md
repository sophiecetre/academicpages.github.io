<b><a href='https://sophiecetre.github.io//files/In search of unanimously preferred income distributions.pdf' style="color:rgb(57, 100, 160) >In Search of Unanimously Preferred Income Distributions. Evidence from a Choice Experiment</a></b>
with Max Lobeck, Claudia Senik and Thierry Verdier. <i>Submitted</i>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><i> Using a choice-experiment in the lab, we look at preferences over pairs of income distributions
within small groups in a firm-like setting. Is one type of distribution capable of attracting votes
unanimously? It turns out that Pareto-dominance is the most important choice criterion: in
binary choices over two distributions, all subjects prefer larger inequality when it makes everyone
weakly better off. This is true, no matter whether income distribution is based on merit or luck.
Unanimity only breaks once subjects' positions within the income distribution are fixed and
known ex-ante. However, even then, 75% subjects prefer Pareto-dominant distributions. This
suggests that effciency motives are of primary importance, more so than the origin of inequality.</i></p>
