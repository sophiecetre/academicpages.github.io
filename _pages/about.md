I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Sciences Po under the supervision of Yann Algan and Claudia Senik. 

I am specialized in behavioral economics and applied microeconomics. My doctoral thesis deals with the determinants of wage inequality focusing on distributive preference at the workplace, fairness concerns, educational choices and discrimination. 

I participate to the <a href='https://www.oecd.org/sdd/trustlab.htm' style="color:blue">Trustlab network</a>, an OECD initiative aiming at studying trust, political opinions and social preferences in several countries.

I am now a researcher at the economics laboratory of the <a href='https://www.irsn.fr/FR/Pages/Home.aspx'  style="color:blue">IRSN</a> (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire).
