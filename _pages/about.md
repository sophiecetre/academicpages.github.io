I am a PhD student in Economics at Sciences Po Paris under the supervision of Yann Algan and Claudia Senik. 

### Research interests
I work on distributive preferences using experimental tools and a personnel economics's perspective. I have a secondary interest in the economics of higher education and textual analysis methods.
