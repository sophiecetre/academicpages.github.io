I am a PhD student in Economics at Sciences Po Paris under the supervision of Yann Algan and Claudia Senik. 

### Research interests
I am specialized in behavioral economics. My doctoral thesis deals with the origins of wage inequality focusing both on educational sorting and employers’ distributive preferences. 

I participate to the <a href='https://www.oecd.org/sdd/trustlab.htm' style="color:blue">Trustlab network</a>, an OECD initiative aiming at studying trust, political opinions and social preferences in several countries.
