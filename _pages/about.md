I hold a PhD in Economics from Sciences Po, supervised by Yann Algan and Claudia Senik. 

My fields of specialization are behavioral economics and applied microeconomics. My research deals with the determinants of wage inequality focusing on distributive preference at the workplace, fairness concerns, educational choices and discrimination. 

I participate to the <a href='https://www.oecd.org/sdd/trustlab.htm' style="color:blue">Trustlab network</a>, an OECD initiative aiming at studying trust, political opinions and social preferences in several countries.

I am now a researcher at the economics laboratory of the <a href='https://www.irsn.fr/FR/Pages/Home.aspx'  style="color:blue">IRSN</a> (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire).
